                        We do not organize individual classes. But let us mention that group lessons are not inferior in efficiency. <br>
                        Moreover, during group discussions, team projects, students reinforce the material learned, gain <br>
                        experience that helps to easily integrate into the work environment.

                    <p class="answerItem">
                        The knowledge of English is highly desirable to participate in the courses. Although the lessons are <br>
                         conducted in Armenian, the terminology, the provided literature and the other resources are in English. <br>
                        In addition English language in the field of IT is unavoidable, which is why English is a prerequisite for <br>
                        becoming a software engineer.

                        Depending on the course, we have online, offline or hybrid classes: theoretical classes (lectures) are held <br>
                        online, and practical classes are held in our classrooms.

                        We believe it’s never too late to start learning, hence we do not have an upper age restriction. <br>
                        But we would like to mention that the courses are quite intensive and are aimed at preparing specialists, <br>
                        so they may be too challenging to access for high school students. <br>
                        In general, we have had both high school students and adults who have participated and successfully <br>
                        completed various courses.
